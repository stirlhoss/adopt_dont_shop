# Adopt, don't Shop

Adopt, don't shop is a website that I built as part of a paired projcet while at the Turing school of software and design. 

The app is hosted at [Adopt don't shop](https://backup-adopt-dont-shop.herokuapp.com/) and currently has no front end formatting. 

## Goals

The main focus of this project was to demonstrate a functional knowledge of many to many relationships with rails.
